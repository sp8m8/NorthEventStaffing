## Implementation Reviews

### What Went Well
- Monorepo structure enables shared types and rapid development.
- Supabase integration is smooth and scalable.
- Zod and drizzle-zod provide robust validation.
- Docs and plans are clear and actionable.

### Areas for Improvement
- UI/UX needs more polish and separation of concerns.
- Home page should be strictly marketing/landing only.
- More automated tests and CI integration needed.
- Attendance and timesheet workflows need real-world testing.
