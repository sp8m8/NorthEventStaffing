# GPS Attendance Marking & Review: Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a GPS-based attendance system for staff to clock in/out at event locations. Attendance records will be confirmed and reviewed by both managers and staff members, ensuring accuracy and accountability.

---

## Goals
- Allow staff to clock in/out using their mobile device's GPS at the event location.
- Record GPS coordinates and timestamp for each attendance action.
- Enable managers to review, confirm, or dispute attendance records.
- Allow staff to view and confirm their own attendance records.
- Integrate with timesheet and payroll workflows.

---

## Steps

### 1. UI/UX Design
- Add clock-in/clock-out buttons in the Staff Portal (mobile-friendly).
- Display current event location and staff's current GPS location.
- Show status (clocked in, clocked out, pending review, confirmed, disputed).
- Manager Portal: Attendance review dashboard with map view and approval controls.

### 2. Frontend Implementation
- Use browser Geolocation API to get staff's GPS coordinates on clock-in/out.
- Prompt for location permissions and handle errors gracefully.
- Send attendance data (user, event, timestamp, GPS) to backend.
- Display attendance history and status to staff and managers.

### 3. Backend API
- Endpoint to receive attendance records (e.g., `/api/attendance/clock-in`, `/api/attendance/clock-out`).
- Store attendance records with user, event, timestamp, and GPS data.
- Endpoint for managers to review, confirm, or dispute records.
- Endpoint for staff to view and confirm their own records.

### 4. Review & Confirmation Workflow
- Attendance records are initially marked as "pending review."
- Managers can confirm or dispute each record (optionally add notes).
- Staff can view and confirm their own records, or raise disputes.
- Final status is stored for payroll and compliance.

### 5. Security & Privacy
- Only allow clock-in/out within a defined radius of the event location.
- Log all attendance actions and reviews for audit trail.
- Comply with GDPR and data privacy requirements.

### 6. Testing
- Test GPS accuracy and edge cases (e.g., denied permissions, spoofing attempts).
- Validate review and confirmation workflows.
- Gather feedback from staff and managers.
