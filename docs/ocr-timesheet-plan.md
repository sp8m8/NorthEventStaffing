# OCR Timesheet Processing with Manual Review: Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system to process uploaded timesheet images, extract relevant data, and allow for manual review and correction before final submission. This will streamline timesheet entry for staff and reduce manual data entry errors.

---

## Goals
- Allow staff to upload photos/scans of timesheets.
- Use OCR to extract timesheet data (names, dates, hours, signatures, etc).
- Present extracted data for manual review and correction.
- Submit reviewed data to the backend for approval and payroll processing.

---

## Steps

### 1. Research & Select OCR Solution
- Evaluate open-source (Tesseract.js) and cloud-based (Google Vision, AWS Textract) OCR APIs.
- Consider privacy, cost, and accuracy.

### 2. UI/UX Design
- Add a timesheet upload feature in the Staff Portal.
- Design a review screen to display extracted data side-by-side with the original image.
- Allow users to edit/correct extracted fields before submission.
- Add status indicators for processing, review, and approval.

### 3. Backend API
- Endpoint to accept image uploads (e.g., `/api/timesheets/upload`).
- Endpoint to accept reviewed/approved timesheet data.
- Store original image, extracted data, and review status in the database.

### 4. OCR Integration
- On upload, send image to OCR service.
- Parse and map OCR results to timesheet fields.
- Return extracted data to frontend for review.

### 5. Manual Review Workflow
- Display extracted data and image to user.
- Allow editing of fields.
- On submit, save reviewed data and mark as ready for approval.
- Admin/manager can approve or request changes.

### 6. Security & Compliance
- Ensure uploaded images are stored securely.
- Log all changes and reviews for audit trail.
- Comply with GDPR and data privacy requirements.

### 7. Testing
- Test with real-world timesheet samples.
- Validate OCR accuracy and review workflow.
- Gather feedback from staff and managers.
